# Privacy Policy for My NFTs

**Last Updated:** February 2026

## Introduction

My NFTs ("we," "us," "our," or "App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, please do not use our App.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Information You Provide Directly

**Wallet Addresses:** When you use the App, you provide Ethereum wallet addresses or ENS names to view your NFT collection. These are entered directly by you and are not stored on our servers.

**Saved Wallet Labels:** If you save wallet addresses locally on your device for quick access, these labels and addresses are stored locally on your iPhone using Supabase's local database and are associated with your device's anonymous user ID.

### B. Information Collected Automatically

**Anonymous User ID:** The App uses Supabase's anonymous authentication to assign a unique anonymous user ID to your device. This ID is used solely to persist your favorite NFTs, hidden NFTs, and saved wallets between sessions on your device.

**Favorites & Hidden NFTs:** Information about which NFTs you've marked as favorites or hidden is stored in our Supabase database, associated with your anonymous user ID.

**Usage Data:** We do not track detailed usage analytics, but standard app crash logs and error reporting may be collected by Apple.

### C. Information from Third Parties

**OpenSea API:** The App integrates with OpenSea's public API to fetch NFT data, collection information, and metadata. OpenSea may collect information about API requests made through our App in accordance with their privacy policy.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

- Display your NFT collection based on the wallet address you provide
- Persist your preferences (favorites, hidden NFTs, saved wallets) across app sessions
- Provide core App functionality
- Troubleshoot and improve the App

**We do not:**
- Sell or share your wallet addresses with third parties
- Use your data for marketing or advertising purposes
- Store your wallet address on our servers (you enter it fresh each session or select from saved wallets)

---

## 3. Data Storage & Security

### Supabase Database

Your favorites, hidden NFTs, and saved wallet labels are stored in a Supabase PostgreSQL database. This data is:
- Associated with an anonymous user ID (not tied to your real identity)
- Protected by Supabase's row-level security policies
- Encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS)

### Device Storage

Saved wallet information is also stored locally on your device and synced to Supabase for backup purposes.

### No Personal Identification

We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any personally identifying information. Your wallet address itself is pseudonymous unless you choose to associate it with your identity through external services.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

### OpenSea

The App uses the OpenSea API to fetch NFT data. When you query a wallet address:
- Your request is sent to OpenSea's servers
- OpenSea may see your wallet address in the API request
- Please review [OpenSea's Privacy Policy](https://opensea.io/privacy) for their data practices

### Supabase

Your app preferences (favorites, hidden NFTs, saved wallets) are stored with Supabase. Please review [Supabase's Privacy Policy](https://supabase.com/privacy) for their data practices.

### Apple

Standard iOS diagnostics and crash reporting may be collected by Apple. Please review [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) for details.

---

## 5. Data Retention

- **Wallet Addresses:** Only stored locally on your device and in memory during app use. Not retained on our servers unless you save them.
- **Favorites & Hidden NFTs:** Retained in our Supabase database indefinitely until you delete the app or clear your data.
- **Anonymous User ID:** Persists across app sessions. You can reset it by uninstalling and reinstalling the App, which will create a new anonymous ID.

---

## 6. Your Rights & Choices

### Access & Deletion

Since all your data is tied to an anonymous user ID (not a personal account), you can:
- Uninstall the App to discontinue data collection
- Reinstall the App to get a fresh anonymous ID and start with no saved data
- Clear your app data through iPhone Settings to delete local storage

We cannot delete your data by email request since it's not tied to a personal account identifier. Your data is automatically managed through your anonymous user ID.

### Do Not Track

The App respects your privacy and does not implement tracking mechanisms beyond what's necessary for core functionality.

---

## 7. Security

We implement industry-standard security measures including:
- HTTPS/TLS encryption for all data in transit
- Supabase's built-in security and authentication features
- No storage of sensitive information like private keys or seed phrases

However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

## 8. Children's Privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with information, we will take steps to delete such information and terminate the child's use of the App.

---

## 9. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technology, legal requirements, or other factors. We will notify you of any material changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Your continued use of the App following the posting of revised Privacy Policy means you accept and agree to the changes.
