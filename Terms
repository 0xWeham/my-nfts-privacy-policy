# Terms of Service

**Last Updated: February 2026**

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By downloading, installing, or using My NFTs ("the App"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the App.

## 2. Description of Service

My NFTs is a read-only NFT viewer that allows you to browse NFT collections associated with Ethereum wallet addresses or ENS names. The App displays NFT images, metadata, and collection information retrieved from third-party APIs.

**The App does not:**
- Function as a cryptocurrency wallet
- Hold custody of any digital assets
- Facilitate buying, selling, or transferring NFTs
- Require account creation or personal information

## 3. User Responsibilities

- You are responsible for the accuracy of any wallet address or ENS name you enter.
- The App does not verify wallet ownership. Viewing a wallet's NFTs does not imply ownership.
- You agree not to use the App for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws.

## 4. Third-Party Services

The App relies on the following third-party services to function:

- **OpenSea API** — for NFT data, images, and collection information
- **Supabase** — for anonymous authentication and preference storage
- **Public Ethereum RPC nodes** — for ENS name resolution

We do not control these services and are not responsible for their availability, accuracy, or content. Your use of data from these services may also be subject to their respective terms and policies.

## 5. NFT Content

NFT images, names, and metadata displayed in the App are the property of their respective creators and owners. The App simply displays publicly available data retrieved from third-party APIs. We do not host, create, or endorse any NFT content displayed within the App.

Some NFT content may be inappropriate or offensive. We are not responsible for the nature of any content displayed.

## 6. No Financial Advice

Any information displayed in the App, including but not limited to floor prices, collection statistics, and market data, is provided for informational purposes only. Nothing in the App constitutes financial, investment, or trading advice. You should not make any financial decisions based solely on information displayed in the App.

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranties

The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not warrant that:

- The App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure
- NFT data, images, or prices will be accurate, complete, or current
- The App will meet your specific requirements

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of data or digital assets, arising from your use of or inability to use the App.

## 9. Data and Privacy

Your use of the App is also governed by our [Privacy Policy](https://github.com/0xWeham/my-nfts-privacy-policy/blob/main/PRIVACY_POLICY.md). By using the App, you consent to the data practices described therein.

## 10. Changes to These Terms

We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Updated terms will be posted at this URL with a revised "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.

## 11. Termination

We reserve the right to discontinue the App or restrict access at any time, without notice or liability.

## 12. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable law, without regard to conflict of law principles.
